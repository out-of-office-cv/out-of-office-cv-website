**OutOfOffice CV** was created by Khoi and Ben---a couple of individuals who
care deeply about Australian democracy. Like many others, we wanted an easy way
to see what our representatives do after they leave office. We couldn't find it,
so we built it.

Our project uses both AI and human intelligence to search the internet for each
former politician and what roles they have taken since leaving office. Our team
then manually verifies the information and includes a source.

We are not politically affiliated and while our best efforts are made to ensure
that the information is accurate, some errors may occur. To get in touch, please
email [info@outofoffice.cv](mailto:info@outofoffice.cv). If you've got
ideas/feature requests/corrections then you can find the website source code and
database on
[GitHub](https://github.com/out-of-office-cv/out-of-office-cv-website), or email
us at [corrections@outofoffice.cv](mailto:corrections@outofoffice.cv).
