# Out of Office CV

[Out of Office CV](https://www.outofoffice.cv) is an open database tracking what
Australian parliamentarians do after they leave office.

While we have systems that track our representatives while they're in office,
there's very little organised information about what happens after they leave.
By making this data clear, accessible, and easy to understand, we can help
support transparency and public discourse.

Politicians are free to choose their post-parliament careers, but those choices
reveal what they value. This project helps you decide whether that aligns with
you.
