# Out of Office CV

Australia has a strong democracy, and we need to make a conscious effort to keep
it that way. While we have systems that track our representatives while they are
in office, there is very little organised information about what happens after
they leave. By making this data clear, accessible, and easy to understand, we
can help close the gap support transparency and public discourse.

Politicians are free to choose their post-parliament careers, but those choices
reveal what they value. This project helps you decide whether that aligns with
you.

## About us

**OutOfOffice** was created by Khoi and Ben---a couple of individuals who care
deeply about Australian democracy. Like many others, we wanted an easy way to
see what our representatives do after they leave office. We couldn’t find it, so
we built it.

Our project uses both AI and human intelligence to search the internet for each
former politician and what roles they have taken since leaving office. Our team
then manually verifies the information and includes a source.

We are not politically affiliated and while our best efforts are made to ensure
that the information is accurate, some errors may occur. To get in touch, please
email [info@outofoffice.cv](mailto:info@outofoffice.cv). If you've got
ideas/feature requests/corrections then you can find the website source code and
database on
[GitHub](https://github.com/out-of-office-cv/out-of-office-cv-website).
