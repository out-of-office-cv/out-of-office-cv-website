# Out of Office (AU)

Australia has a strong democracy, and we need to make a conscious effort to keep
it that way. While we have systems that track our representatives while they are
in office, there is very little organised information about what happens after
they leave. By making this data clear, accessible, and easy to understand, we
can help close the gap support transparency and public discourse.

Politicians are free to choose their post-parliament careers, but those choices
reveal what they value. This project helps you decide whether that aligns with
you.

## About us

**OutOfOffice** was created by a few individuals who care deeply about
Australian democracy. Like many others, we wanted an easy way to see what our
representatives do after they leave office. We couldn’t find it, so we built it.

Our project uses AI to search the internet for each former politician and what
roles they have taken since leaving office. Our team then manually verifies the
information and includes a source. We assign these into gigs into one of our
categories to make it easy to navigate.

We are not politically affiliated and while our best efforts are made to ensure
that the information is accurate, some errors may occur.

If you would like more to contact us, please email [TODO](insert email) and you
can find code on our github [TODO](TODO).
