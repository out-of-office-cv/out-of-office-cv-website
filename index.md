# Out of Office CV

Australia has a strong democracy, and we need to make a conscious effort to keep
it that way. While we have systems that track our representatives while they are
in office, there is very little organised information about what happens after
they leave. By making this data clear, accessible, and easy to understand, we
can help close the gap support transparency and public discourse.

Politicians are free to choose their post-parliament careers, but those choices
reveal what they value. This project helps you decide whether that aligns with
you.
