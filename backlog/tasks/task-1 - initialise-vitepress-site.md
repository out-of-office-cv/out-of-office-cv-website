This repo should be a VitePress site. It should have a landing page, and the
main content should be populated from a data file of Australian Politicians.

First, get the data from here:
https://github.com/openaustralia/openaustralia-parser/blob/main/data/representatives.csv

Use createContentLoader
(https://vitepress.dev/guide/data-loading#createcontentloader) to iterate over
the dataset and display some basic details about them.
